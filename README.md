Steem Cloud will be an investment game built on the Steem blockchain. 
This is my first GitHub project and will serve as a learning exercise, at the very least. 
Hope to find some interest and help in this endeavor.

In a nutshell, the game will input external cryptocurrencies, offer a level-based discount and output STEEM depending on that level. 
So far, there are 6 Types of Investors and 30 Levels. 

What's needed to begin?
- A website and Steem acount for game
- Login through Steemconnect to verify Steem account
- Steem account gets assigned a DOGE deposit-only address
- Website retrieves, publishes and updates STEEM price
- Website retrieves, publishes and updates DOGE price
- Calculate DOGE per STEEM value
- Create 1st Type: Dragonfly Investor
- Create Level 1 investment
- Transfer DOGE into player account
- Level 1 Dragonfly Investor gets 50% discount on DOGE
- Level 1 Dragonfly Investor can only invest 1 millisteem (0.001 STEEM) worth of DOGE per 24 hours
- Create INVEST button with DOGE price discounted 50%
- Click INVEST
- Alert (ARE YOU SURE?) YES/NO
- Click YES
- Deduct DOGE amount from player's total
- @steemcloud account send 0.001 STEEM to player Steem account with Memo (Steem Cloud Reward)
- INVEST button converts to countdown CLOCK (23:59)
- 24 hours later player repeats 
- Level 1 Complete

Ideally, the blockchain would keep track of the total number of investments made, as this will determine when a player levels up.
