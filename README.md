# steemcloud
Steem Cloud will be an investment game built on the Steem blockchain. 
This is my first GitHub project and will serve as a learning exercise, at the very least. 
Hope to find some interest and help in this endeavor.

What will Steem Cloud offer and address for the Steemit community?
- The opportunity for those with low Steem Power to gain STEEM from a sources other than posting or upvoting
- A chance to learn about other cryptocurrencies and how to transfer them
- A way to bring funding, through other cryptocurrencies, into the STEEM system
- A way to bring new accounts to Steemit
- An investment model that favors those with less STEEM rather than favoring those with more STEEM, but without alienating or demeaning those with larger stakes in STEEM

In a nutshell, the game will input external cryptocurrencies, offer a level-based discount and output STEEM depending on that level. 
So far, there are 6 Types of Investors and 30 Levels. 

What's needed?

- A website and Steem acount for game
  - Since I do not know how to build these kinds of websites, I would like to suggest that either you can build it from scratch or you can simply add it to your already existing site, at least to test it and see how it goes. Initially, your own Steem account can be used before commiting to a game account. I'd be available for testing and playing.
  - The account ***steemcloud*** already exixts, so you will have to use another name like @steem.cloud or @steem-cloud
  
- Login through Steemconnect to verify Steem account
- Steem account gets assigned a DOGE deposit-only address
  - Ideally, **Option 1** would create DOGE addresses through Blocktrades and be linked to the @steem.cloud wallet so that when the DOGE are sent, they are converted and deposited directly as STEEM. Otherwise, **Option 2** would incorporate a DOGE address generator, and create a master DOGE address where all DOGE that are first deposited in the personal addresses would then be moved to the master address, which would then move the DOGE into the @steem.cloud account through Blocktrades. This is also true for any future coins that are added, like LTC, DASH, ect. Any coins that are not available through Blocktrades would be forced to take the second option, with the addition of needing to be sent to external exchanges to be converted.
- Website retrieves, publishes and updates STEEM price
- Website retrieves, publishes and updates DOGE price
- Calculate DOGE per STEEM value

- Level 1 Dragonfly Investor gets 50% discount on DOGE
- Level 1 Dragonfly Investor can only invest 1 millisteem (0.001 STEEM) worth of DOGE per 24 hours
- Create INVEST button with DOGE price discounted 50%
- Click INVEST
- Alert (ARE YOU SURE?) YES/NO
- Click YES
- Deduct DOGE amount from player's total
- @steem.cloud account send 0.001 STEEM to player Steem account with Memo (Steem Cloud Reward)
- INVEST button converts to countdown CLOCK (23:59)
- 24 hours later player repeats 
- Level 1 Complete

Ideally, the blockchain would keep track of the total number of investments made, as this will determine when a player levels up.

***STEEM CLOUD STORY***

*MINNOWY AND THE STEEM CLOUD*

For many years now the inhabitants of the water world Steemia have grown ever more discontent. Despite the growth in population, the smaller aquatic creatures still have a difficult time accumulating Millisteem from the vast waters. Thousands of plankton are still stuck on the ocean floor and far too many minnows can't swim into the deeper waters to harness the much sought after Millisteem. Even with the help of dolphins, minnows can never reach the depth of orcas or whales, and certainly can not compete with the occasional shark.

Our story begins with Minnowy, a minnow whose parents gave him that name to always remind him of his place in the Steemia ecosystem. After years of swimming in shallow waters, collecting small amounts of Millisteem here and there, Minnowy, out of frustration, decided to swim towards the dark depths of the ocean where legends spoke of unbelievable quantities of Millisteem and great storms that blackened the sky. As he swam with tenacious determination towards the deep, a Voice called to him and warned him to go no further or risk losing his life.

"Who are you? What do you want from me? I'm tired of living this minnow life!" Minnowy lamented.

"Swim away from the deep as far as you can, and you will find another life. It's time to fly, Minnowy, it's time to fly," responded the Voice.

"But I'm a fish; I can't fly!" he argued.

"Swim away from the deep as far as you can, and when you reach the right moment repeat TIME TO FLY 3 times," the Voice commanded and then disappeared.

Minnowy, tired and confused, turned around and began to swim back towards shallow waters. Distracted by thoughts of that mysterious Voice, Minnowy did not notice that he had swam much further away from where he had spent most of his life. He noticed that ahead of him the plant life began to seem different; there were large stalks of strange grass that rose above the water.

"Life above the surface of the water?" he questioned, " How is that possible? I've only ever seen dolphins break through the water/air barrier!"

Looking more intently ahead as he swam towards the grassy jungle, he noticed a golden blade of grass rising out of the water with a Millisteem droplet hanging from the tip. He thought about the words of the Voice and imagined that this must be the right moment.

"TIME TO FLY! TIME TO FLY! TIME TO FLY!"

As he spoke those magic words, a colossal white cloud appeared in the sky and a fiery being flew down towards Minnowy.

"Well done Minnowy! Now you can live your new life. Climb the golden blade and collect your Millisteem. From tomorrow on, you will be able to collect your Millisteem from the Steem Cloud, and day by day you will collect more and more and fly higher and higher until one day you become as I am. Steem Clouds hover over the deepest depths of your ocean, where only larger fish can swim, and draw liquidity from the subaquatic abyss, converting it into billions of Millisteem and raining it down into distant waters. Are you ready Minnowy?" the Fire Being asked.

"I'm ready!" Minnowy proclaimed.

The Fire Being rose back into the Steem Cloud and Minnowy began to feel a strange sensation under his belly, as legs grew out from his body. Slowly, and cautiously, he climbed the golden blade of grass until he reached the tip and collected his Millisteem. Suddenly, from his back began to spring out wings. Again, he heard the Voice of the Fire Being.

"No longer will you be called Minnowy! You are now Dragonfly! Fly Dragonfly, TIME TO FLY!"
